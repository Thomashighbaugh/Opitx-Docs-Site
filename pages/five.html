              <h2><strong>Back Up Best Practices</strong></h2>
              <p>
                The use of Back Ups is reccomended regardless of operating
                system, due to the fickle nature of technology and the assumed
                importance of the work the user is doing with their system.
                Opitx was designed to help give the user control of where they
                store their files, for purposes of creating more sustainable
                back ups. Here, a list of practices to help the user approach
                back ups effectively followed by a list of services and options
                to use to insure that the back ups are robust.

              <h3><strong>1. Use Remote Storage</strong></h3>
              <p>
                This means that one should use back ups that are not physically
                in the location that your machine is. This prevents them from
                being susciptible to destruction if something destroys the
                machine, meaning that while the system is lost, the work that
                was done on it is not.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h3><strong>2. Frequent and Regular Back Ups</strong></h3>
              <p>
                The user should back up their data as a force of habit in order
                to insure that the data is not lost for any purpose the other
                best practices are designed to prevent. Saving data to multiple
                locations after completing work, or before leaving for any
                reason, is generally the best method of accomplishing this.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h3><strong>3. Consider How Long to Keep Back Ups</strong></h3>
              <p>
                When space is limited, which may not be a practical concern with
                notes, then it is best to consider how long one should keep back
                ups before getting rid of them to make room for additional
                items. Even with notes, there is a lifespan of utility for those
                notes that after which it is no longer necessary to keep them.
                Considering this, it is always good to include either a topic or
                date for later identification and classification of the note.
              </p>
              <hr />
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3">
              <h3><strong>4. Keep Back Ups Encrypted and Protected</strong></h3>
              <p>
                While not necessarily important if one is merely taking notes on
                code-related topics, it is still worthwhile to consider using
                some encryption when backing up to mitigate any potential
                malicious actors from acquiring data to obtain knowledge that
                could be used to gain insight into the creator of the data. One
                way is using encrypted back ups that gain their encryption
                through the back up service (such as Mega or Turtl) or by means
                of a separate encryption service.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h3><strong>5. Store Back Ups on RAID Arrays</strong></h3>
              <p>
                When setting up on site storage, the most robust manner of
                insuring no data loss is to use RAID arrays in RAID 1, which
                uses two or more harddrives copied in identical format providing
                access to the data regardless if there is a failure in a single
                drive.
              </p>
              <hr />
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3">
              <h3><strong>6. Stack Your Back Up Solutions</strong></h3>
              <p>
                Stacking back ups is another way to say that back up solutions
                should be redundant. Having just one back up makes for a single
                point of failure that means that the data is as vulnerable to
                catastrophe as not backing it up. Considering that the below
                listed options all have a free option, this does not entail any
                expense other than the extra few seconds of using the extra
                storage method.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h3><strong>7. Two Copies On Site and One Off Site</strong></h3>
              <p>
                This is a minimal reccomendation, as having more than one off
                site back up is not much additional work nor additional cost.
                Nevertheless, data should at least be backed up in an
                arrangement such as having a copy on the system it was made, an
                external/extra harddrive and one remote service. This insures
                that the data is insulated against most common causes of
                catastrophic data loss.
              </p>

                <h3><strong>Extra/External Harddrive</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  Having an additional harddrive, or external if you primarily
                  use a laptop, is the first line of defense against loosing
                  your data and is recommended regardless of the other options
                  pursued for backing up your work.

                <p>
                  Providing a user experience very similar to Dropbox, this
                  option offers even more storage (15GBs) and runs from an
                  AppImage, making its setup a simple process. It also has a
                  mobile client, which is well integrated with Android thus
                  providing seamless access to your notes on the go.

                <h3><strong>Turtl</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  Also a Markdown editor, what it lacks in comfort in using as a
                  note taker, it does offer encrypted and free back ups for the
                  user to use as a redundant back up on top of other solutions.
                  Offering only 50mb for note storage, most users will find this
                  sufficient. It also enables one to provide their own server
                  using, giving access to as much storage as the user has.

                <h3><strong>GitLab</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  While offering the same functionality and features of GitHub,
                  following GitHub's acquistion by Microsoft, this option may be
                  more comfortable to long time Linux users or those with a bad
                  taste in their mouths regarding Microsoft. GitLab can also be
                  set up on one's own server, providing either remote or on site
                  back ups fully under one's control.

              <p>
                Dropbox provides the user with a seamless Linux desktop
                experience. While the free account does provide the user with
                only 2 GB of space, this comes without requiring additional work
                and the desktop client is easy to use and leaves a directory in
                your /home/ folder that can easily be the point into which you
                deposit your notes. At 2GB, so long as the user is only
                depositing notes then it is more than enough storage.

              <hr />
              <h3><strong>Mega</strong></h3>
              <p>
                While raved about on clickbait Linux sites, this option is the
                author's least favorite due to the time limits on the
                &quot;extra&quot; storage it gives users after they accomplish
                certain tasks. With its Linux desktop support, it is an option,
                though be forewarned that its desktop client can be a resource
                hog. Additionally, the user should be aware that in cases of
                data clearing, the quickest that items can be removed from the
                &quot;rubbish bin&quot; is 7 days and so it is possible for the
                account to become jammed with useless files, making additional
                storage with this option a little more hairy. Should likely be
                used as a back up for a back up (unless willing to pay). This
                trash is also not accessible to the user, so any advanced
                deletion of the files before the seven days is also not
                possible. Offers encryption, making it a viable choice
                regardless.

              <h3><strong>GitHub</strong></h3>
              <p>
                Using a GitHub account as a storage solution for notes is also
                possible. GitHub recognizes Markdown and will display it
                appropiately, like on Opitx, and makes the notes accessible to
                the rest of your team (or the world at large). This method may
                not insulate the notes from prying eyes, but unless you are
                using Opitx for some nefarious purpose (not recommended) then
                this should not be a problem. Simply store notes in a designated
                repo to utilize this back up solution with the version control
                functionality of Git baked right in.
