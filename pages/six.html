              This enables the user to inspect the code base, modify it,
              redistribute it or do with it whatever they would wish. This is in
              line with the Free and Open Source ethos of the Linux community.
              Being an application intended for use with Linux, it is only
              rational to offer it in the same spirit as the Operating Systems
              that it runs on. Additionally, users may feel free to fork the
              application and add to it, the author is extremely open to all
              suggestions in bringing to the user a note taking application that
              they actually want to use and did not write this application to
              merely impress hiring managers (as many other such applications
              seem to have truly been written to such purposes).
