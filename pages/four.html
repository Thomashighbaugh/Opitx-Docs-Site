                <h3><strong>Markdown Based Note Taker</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  Like many Linux note taking applications, this one eschews the
                  complexity and menu-heavy system of Rich Text Editors and
                  instead uses the relative simplicity of the Markdown mark-up
                  language. This language is used in numerous contexts to give
                  the user a quick way to format text that does not require
                  program dependent learning curves while still providing the
                  text editing and formatting options modern users expect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reason for its use here, as well as in the author's daily
                  life, is because it does not consume resources like
                  LibreOffice or its commercial alternatives. Additionally,
                  Markdown can be used to create code blocks with syntax
                  highlighting rather easily compared to any other method of
                  transcribing notes on code-related subjects.
                </p>

                <h3>Three Easily Toggled Viewer Modes</h3>
                <p>
                  Opitx includes an easily used Panel-View Changer. At the top
                  of the application are three arrows which indicate the various
                  modes Panel-Viewer available.
                </p>
                <h5>Dual Panel Mode</h5>
                <p>
                  Indicated by the middle arrow and set as the default, in this
                  mode both the Markdown and its output are shown. This enables
                  the user to see changes in real time as they use the
                  application.
                </p>
                <h5>Rendered Mode</h5>
                <p>
                  For use in examining the document's appearance with the
                  Markdown rendered, this view mode is indicated by the
                  left-facing arrow. Good to make sure the document is as it was
                  intended.
                </p>
                <h5>Markdown Mode</h5>
                <p>
                  The markdown document without any rendering, which is useful
                  for those who know what the document will look like or don't
                  want any distractions while writing. Indicated by the
                  right-facing arrow.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h3>Storage Freedom</h3>
                <p>
                  Unlike many competitors, Opitx allows you to choose exactly
                  where each file is saved. That means that you are not bound to
                  some database that will save your notes as incomprehensible
                  strings or using a service prone to being temperamental. This
                  allows you to save the document to multiple locations
                  accessible to you through your file system and organize your
                  notes without worry about &quot; notebooks&quot;,
                  &quot;boards&quot; or any other application specific term with
                  varying amounts of utility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This feature is operated by the menu option &quot;Save&quot;
                  which opens a dialog asking you where in your filesystem to
                  save the file. This is also accompanied by the
                  &quot;Open&quot; feature that enables you to open a Markdown
                  file for editing.
                </p>

                <h3>Multiple Installation Options</h3>
                <p>
                  Opitx is available in several Linux package formats for use on
                  any Linux platform. As a Linux first and FOSS program, it is
                  important to the author that it be made available to all Linux
                  users. These options were chosen due to the ease of
                  integration and use by any prospective user. See the
                  <a href="two.html">installation page</a> for more information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At present there are no plans to support either properitery
                  OS, though the nature of Opitx as Free and Open Source does
                  not preclude someone else making versions for them.
                </p>

              <h3>Syntax Highlighting from Highlight.js</h3>
              <p>
                The Highlight.js functionality provided with the Markdown
                rendered provides support for over 20 languages. This feature
                makes code-related notes easier to read and provides the most
                important functionality to the author when crafting Opitx.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h3>CodeMirror Theme</h3>
              <p>
                The editor theme was provided by CodeMirror. It was chosen to
                match the general theme of the application while still being
                easy to read and highlighting the appropiate parts of Markdown's
                syntax in a pleasant way. Future versions of Opitx hope to
                enable the user to change the theme, so keep on the look out!
